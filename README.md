Currently using:
```
python3 sync_today.py
```
Will update this to ignore L1, since Will will be turning that off.

Also, will be filtering for BC as the coverage was expanded.

Can use: 
```
python3 download_gid_latest.py [gid #1] [gid #2] .. [gid #N]
```
to download only the most-recent data for specific ["grid id"](https://eatlas.org.au/data/uuid/f7468d15-12be-4e3f-a246-b2882a324f59)
